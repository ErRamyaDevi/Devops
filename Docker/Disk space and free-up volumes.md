#### The error message failed to register layer: write /usr/lib/mongosh_crypt_v1.so: no space left on device indicates that your Docker environment has run out of disk space, preventing Docker from writing the required files for a container or image.
## Steps to Resolve the Issue:
# 1. Check Disk Space Usage:
```
df -h
```
# 2. Remove Unused Docker Images, Containers, and Volumes:
+ Remove stopped containers:
  ```
  docker container prune
  ```
+ Remove unused images:
  ```
  docker image prune
  docker image prune -a
  ```
+ Remove unused volumes:
  ```
  docker volume prune
  ```
+ Remove unused networks:
  ```
  docker network prune
  ```
+ Remove all unused resources at once:
  ```
  docker system prune -a --volumes
  ```
# 3.Free Up System Disk Space:
  + Delete or move large files that are not needed.
  + Clear system caches (e.g., apt-get clean for Ubuntu/Debian systems).
  + Uninstall unused software packages.
# 4.Check Docker Storage Directory - /var/lib/docker by default
  ```
  sudo du -sh /var/lib/docker/
  ```
# 5.Expand Docker Storage (Optional) If you frequently run into space issues:
  + Moving Docker's storage directory to a larger disk or partition.
  + Adding more storage to your system.
# 6.Restart Docker:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart docker.service
  sudo systemctl restart docker
```
